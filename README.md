# pantry-ai-recipes
The goal of this app is that you can enter the name of your ingredient and its amount in the boxes. Ingredients with the same standardized name done by gpt-5.2 are combined into one entry in database. I am proud of how i was able to get the ai working with the database. In terms of what was the hardest, it had to be working with netlify. I was not expecting to be cut off of credits as i was working on the project and I ended up in a panic trying to figure out how to fix this issue. If I were to do something differently, I would use render for the front and backend from the get go. This way i wouldnt have to struggle with functionality.
